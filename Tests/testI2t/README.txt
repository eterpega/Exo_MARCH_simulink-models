This tests the I2t function based on the data of when the mnotor broke or on generated data (FAKE).

IMPORTANT NOTE:

It uses the library I2t present in this folder and not the one used
in the actual model (as you want to be able to change the constants easily.)

So if changes are made in the code just copy paste the code into this I2t block.
